/**
 * @defgroup Stack Stack
 * @brief A classic Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) stack data structure.
 *
 * This module provides a simple and flexible stack implementation based on a singly linked list.
 * It supports standard stack operations like push, pop, and peek.
 *
 * @note The user of this library is responsible for understanding the memory management implications
 * when using `freeStack()` versus `destroyStack()`.
